<h2 id="dynamic-programming">Dynamic Programming</h2>
<p>Dynamic programming is a problem-solving technique that involves breaking down a complex problem into simpler overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once, storing the solutions in a table to avoid redundant computations. It&#39;s particularly useful when a problem has optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems.</p>
<h3 id="easy-explanation">Easy Explanation:</h3>
<p>Imagine you are climbing a staircase, and you can take one or two steps at a time. The question is, how many different ways can you reach the top?</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Brute Force Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You could try every possible combination of steps and count the ways, but this would take a long time and be inefficient.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamic Programming Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Break the problem into smaller parts: How many ways to reach the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and so on steps?</li>
<li>Solve each smaller problem only once and store the solutions in a table.</li>
<li>Build up to the larger problem by combining the solutions of smaller subproblems.</li>
<li>The answer for the top step is the sum of the ways to reach the last two steps.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Problem: Stock Trading for Maximum Profit</strong></p>
<p>Imagine you&#39;re a stock trader, and you have the historical prices of a stock for each day. Your goal is to find the best days to buy and sell to maximize your profit.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Brute Force Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You could try every combination of buying and selling days, calculating the profit for each, but this would be time-consuming.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Dynamic Programming Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Break the problem into subproblems: What&#39;s the maximum profit I can make on the 1st day, 2nd day, and so on?</li>
<li>Solve each subproblem once, storing the maximum profit in a table.</li>
<li>The maximum profit for a given day is the maximum of either:<ul>
<li>The profit from the previous day.</li>
<li>The maximum profit from a day when you bought the stock plus the profit from selling on the current day.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The answer is the maximum profit you can make overall.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this way, dynamic programming helps you find the optimal solution efficiently by avoiding redundant calculations.</p>
<p>In summary, dynamic programming is like breaking down a big problem into smaller, manageable pieces, solving each piece just once, and using those solutions to build up to the overall solution. It&#39;s a powerful technique used in various fields, from algorithms and optimization problems to finance and resource management.</p>
<p>The Knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem where you are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and you want to determine the maximum value you can obtain by selecting a subset of items without exceeding a given weight limit.</p>
<h3 id="easy-explanation-1">Easy Explanation:</h3>
<p>Imagine you have a knapsack (a backpack) with a limited weight capacity, and you want to maximize the total value of the items you can carry.

<li><p><strong>Building the Table:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For each item and for each possible weight capacity (starting from 0 to the total capacity of the knapsack):<ul>
<li>If the current item&#39;s weight is less than or equal to the current capacity, consider including it.</li>
<li>Calculate the maximum value between:<ul>
<li>The value obtained by excluding the current item (value from the previous row in the table).</li>
<li>The value obtained by including the current item plus the value obtained from the remaining capacity (value from the previous row in the same column corresponding to the remaining capacity).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
<ul>

<h3 id="real-life-example-7">Real-Life Example:</h3>
<p>Imagine you are organizing a chess tournament and need to set up the chessboard for a friendly game between two players. The N-Queens problem arises as you want to arrange the queens (representing chess pieces) on the board in such a way that no queen threatens another. The solution to the N-Queens problem ensures a conflict-free chessboard.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Chessboard:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An (N \times N) chessboard where N represents the size of the board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Queens:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>N queens represent the chess pieces to be placed on the board.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Objective:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Arrange the queens on the board so that no two queens threaten each other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="visualization-of-solution">Visualization of Solution:</h3>
<p>For example, for (N = 4), one possible solution is:</p>
<pre><code>Solution 1:
[Q . . .]
[. . Q .]
[. Q . .]
[. . . Q]
</code></pre>
<p>This configuration satisfies the non-attack constraint, and no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.</p>
<p>In summary, the N-Queens problem is a classic example of a combinatorial problem that can be efficiently solved using the backtracking approach. The goal is to find all distinct arrangements of queens on the chessboard that satisfy the non-attack constraint.</p>

<p>A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle in an undirected graph that visits each vertex exactly once and returns to the starting vertex. The Hamiltonian cycle problem is to determine whether a Hamiltonian cycle exists in a given graph.</p>
