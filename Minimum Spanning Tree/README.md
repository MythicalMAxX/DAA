<h2 id="minimum-spanning-tree">Minimum Spanning Tree:</h2>
<p>A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a tree that spans all the vertices in a connected, undirected graph and has the minimum possible total edge weight. Finding the minimum spanning tree is a classic problem in graph theory with practical applications, such as designing efficient networks and infrastructure.</p>
<p>One of the most well-known algorithms for finding the minimum spanning tree is Prim&#39;s algorithm. Another popular algorithm is Kruskal&#39;s algorithm. Both algorithms guarantee that the resulting tree has the minimum total edge weight.</p>

<h2 id="prims-algorithm-1">Prim&#39;s Algorithm</h2>
<p>Prim&#39;s algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a connected, undirected graph. The algorithm grows the MST one vertex at a time, always selecting the vertex that has the smallest edge connecting it to the current MST. The process continues until all vertices are included in the MST.</p>

<li><p><strong>Initialization:</strong></p>
